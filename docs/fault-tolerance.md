# Fault tolerance

- How does the application handle errors and distribution?

## Fault tolerance experiments

- How does the system behave under Node/CPU/Memory/Hardware/... errors and failures?
- What happens during network interruptions and partitioning?
- How do error handling mechanisms affect efficiency/scale/latency/throughput/... etc.?
- Are there any worst/best case considerations?
