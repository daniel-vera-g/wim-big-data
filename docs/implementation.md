# Project evaluation

- Correctness and usefulness of the solution
- suitability of the solution for big data scenarios (scalability, reliability, maintainability)
- own contribution

## Big Data

- Why is your problem a "big data problem"?
- Why canâ€™t you solve it traditional storage/analytics/database technologies?
- Where does your prototype take shortcuts, what would have to be considered in real scenarios?

- Which system/software/Spark/HDFS components contribute to the execution and how?
- How and with which components (executors, workers, HDFS-nodes/storage-nodes), etc., are the data analyses/queries/queries mapped to the hardware resources (CPU/memory/disk/network)?
